thud - extremely primitive console library for roguelike games. [LuaJIT, Win32 only now]

## Usage

    local thud = require 'thud-win32'  -- loads the library [LuaJIT required for FFI and bit libraries]
    
    thud.gotoxy(1, 1)  -- moves cursor to top-left corner of console window
    
    local k = thud.waitforkey() -- returns a table with fields:
    print(k.code) -- long name of pressed key (consult `vk` in `thud-win32.lua`), or number code if unknown
    print(k.char) -- character typed on keyboard ('A' for [Shift]-[A]), or nil if special key like [F1]
    print(k.alt, k.ctrl, k.shift) -- true or false, describes modifier keys used
